Generate a BPMN 2.0 process model in XML format using the Camunda-compatible structure shown below as a mandatory template. But do not generate in this promt, just save and analyze this informations. 

You must strictly preserve the XML structure, namespaces, and hierarchy of the provided example. All generated elements must conform to BPMN 2.0 and Camunda execution requirements. 

The generated BPMN model MUST satisfy the following constraints: 
- Exactly one executable bpmn:process element. 
- At least one start event and at least one end event. 
- All BPMN elements must have unique identifiers. 
- All tasks, gateways, and intermediate events must have a non-empty name attribute. 
- Every sequenceFlow must define both sourceRef and targetRef referencing existing elements. 
- All BPMN elements must be represented in BPMN-DI using bpmndi:BPMNShape or bpmndi:BPMNEdge. 
- Every BPMN-DI shape must include dc:Bounds. 
- Do not introduce any process elements that were not identified in previous extraction steps. 
- All outgoing sequence flows from decision points (e.g., exclusive gateways) MUST have a non-empty name attribute that clearly describes the decision outcome. 
- Do NOT use pools or lanes. The process must be modeled as a single process without lane-based partitioning. 
- Tasks MUST be modeled using appropriate BPMN task types based on their role in the process: 
- Use userTask for activities performed by human actors. 
- Use serviceTask for automated or system-executed activities. 
- Use scriptTask for internal data processing or transformation logic. 
- Use businessRuleTask for decision logic or rule-based evaluation. 
- Generic bpmn:task elements MUST NOT be used unless no more specific task type applies. 

Use the following XML structure as a mandatory template:
