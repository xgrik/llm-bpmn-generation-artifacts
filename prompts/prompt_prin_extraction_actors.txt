Based on the provided healthcare process document, identify all actors (participants, roles, organizational units, or systems) that actively participate in the execution of the described process. 

Actors may include both human roles (e.g., clinicians, nurses) and technical systems (e.g., healthcare information systems, decision support systems). 

Only include actors that: 
- perform actions, 
- make decisions, or 
- are directly responsible for steps within the process. 

List each actor with a short justification based on the source document. Do not include actors that are only mentioned for context or background. 

From the same healthcare process document, identify actors that are mentioned in the text but should NOT be included as participants in the BPMN process model. 

These may include: 
- informational roles, 
- external stakeholders not involved in execution, 
- entities referenced only for context, regulation, or reporting. 

For each identified actor, briefly explain why it is excluded from the process model.
